# Wiper Malware
Wiper malware's primary function is to delete, overwrite, or corrupt files—sometimes targeting critical components like the Master Boot Record (MBR), which controls the system’s ability to boot. Once the system is affected, it becomes inoperable, and recovering the data can be either difficult or impossible without backups.
