# Wiper Malware
Wiper malware's primary function is to delete, overwrite, or corrupt files—sometimes targeting critical components like the Master Boot Record (MBR), which controls the system’s ability to boot. Once the system is affected, it becomes inoperable, and recovering the data can be either difficult or impossible without backups.
#### When developing wiper malware from a malware developer’s perspective in C++, the focus is on creating a modular structure that ensures maximum destruction and evasion of detection. Here's a complete breakdown of how you could structure such malware while considering different aspects like system control, destruction techniques, and evasion.

## Structure of Wiper Malware (C++)
### 1. Initialization & Privilege Escalation
The first thing the malware needs to do is ensure it has administrator privileges to access critical system files, the Master Boot Record (MBR), and other areas of the system that require elevated permissions.

* Objective: Gain necessary privileges to execute destructive actions.

### 2. Self-Persistence and Evasion Mechanisms
To ensure that the malware can evade basic detection techniques and remain operational even after a reboot, it may try to achieve persistence by adding itself to Windows Startup or modifying system configurations like the registry.

* Objective: Keep the malware running and evade antivirus tools.

 ### 3. Destructive Payload: Wiping Files
 The core functionality of wiper malware is to delete or overwrite files on the system, rendering the machine unusable.

* Objective: Wipe critical files to make data unrecoverable.

### 4. Overwriting the Master Boot Record (MBR)

* This is a destructive technique used by many wipers. Overwriting the MBR ensures the system cannot boot, effectively bricking the machine.

### 5. Self-Destruction
After the malware completes its operation, it may choose to delete itself from the disk to avoid forensic detection.

* Objective: Erase traces of the malware itself.

### 6. Trigger Conditions (Optional Logic Bomb)
A common feature in wiper malware is setting a trigger condition, like a specific date or event. This makes the malware stay hidden until the conditions are met, making detection harder.

* Objective: Delay execution until the right time (like a scheduled logic bomb).

Objective: Corrupt the MBR to make the system unbootable.
