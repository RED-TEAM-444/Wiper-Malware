# Wiper-Malware
## Introduction ##
Wiper malware is designed with a single destructive goal: to erase or corrupt data on a system, making it unusable or causing irreversible damage. As a malware developer, understanding how wiper malware works can give insight into its structure, behavior, and impact.
## How Wiper Malware Works
Wiper malware's primary function is to delete, overwrite, or corrupt files—sometimes targeting critical components like the Master Boot Record (MBR), which controls the system’s ability to boot. Once the system is affected, it becomes inoperable, and recovering the data can be either difficult or impossible without backups.
